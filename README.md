Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Sky
I am an aspiring developer
I'm currently learning to program. I've loved technology for longer than I can remember. Before double digits I was fluent in word processing applications but have always been intrigued by the mechanisms that make things work. When I was little this manifested itself in the form of disassembling anything and everything, it started with mechanical things (my poor childhood toys) but as I aged I wanted to understand the mechanisms that made the world work, needless to say, I stumbled upon coding.* 🌍  I'm based in Virginia* 🧠  I'm learning CS50* 🤝  I'm open to collaborating on Any interesting projects
